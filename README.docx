Similar Image Search using FAISS and ResNet Feature Extraction
the project implements find similar image in the dataset for the query image and  if the image can't be matched find the similar based on the  rating  to the query image 

This project implements a FAISS-based HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing system for fast and efficient similar image search using ResNet-based feature extraction.
It also incorporates PCA for dimensionality reduction and metadata analysis using image EXIF data.
  

ðŸ”¹ Features
1. ResNet-18 for Feature Extraction
Uses ResNet-18, a pre-trained deep learning model, to extract high-level feature representations from images.
The final classification layer is removed to obtain feature vectors instead of labels.
Images are processed using predefined transformations:
Resized to 224Ã—224 pixels
Converted to a tensor
Normalized with mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
Extracted feature vectors are normalized for better similarity comparison.
2. FAISS HNSW Indexing for Fast Search
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to perform efficient nearest-neighbor searches.
Uses Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for faster approximate search.
Instead of a brute-force search, FAISS stores and indexes feature vectors for fast retrieval.
3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for Dimensionality Reduction
Extracted features from ResNet are 512-dimensional.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduces the dimensions to 128 while maintaining relevant information.
Reduces memory footprint and speeds up similarity searches.
4. Metadata Extraction (e.g., Image Ratings)
Reads EXIF metadata from images to extract rating information.
If a rating is available, it's converted into a vector and added to the index.
This allows more accurate searches by incorporating additional metadata.
5. Interactive Streamlit UI for Image Search
A Streamlit-based user interface allows:
Uploading multiple images for indexing.
Uploading a query image to find similar images.
Specifying how many similar images (k) to retrieve.
Displaying results in an easy-to-view format.
